Review all reserved words and make sure i didnt miss anything.

Error handeling for the following. Some of these rules are best practice and my personal preferance, but will compile. They will be noted as such.

; not followed by comments
a line with two equals signs
IF THEN all on one line not requiring an END
Try to figure out how to handel using a variable before it is initialized

would love to work out LINTER API, not sure if i can without compiler.

below is close but does not work.
{
"patterns": [
  {
  "comment": "this matches THEN, ELSE, END ELSE, ON ERROR, LOCKED when not followed by END",
  "match": "(THEN|ELSE|END ELSE|ON ERROR|LOCKED)(?:(.*[^END]))",
  "name": "meta.no.end.function.pick",
  "captures":{
      "1": {"name": "invalid.illegal.pick"}
      }
  },
]
}
